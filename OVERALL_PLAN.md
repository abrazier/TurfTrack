1. Project Setup and Structure

   - [x] Create a new project folder (lawn_tracker) with separate subdirectories for the backend and frontend.
   - [x] Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for your project.

1. Backend Setup with FastAPI and UV

   - [x] Initialize a new Python project in the backend folder.
   - [x] Set up a virtual environment using UV for package and environment management.
   - [x] Install FastAPI, uvicorn, asyncpg (or SQLAlchemy with async support), and other required packages.
   - [x] Create a basic FastAPI app with endpoints for logging lawn activities, tracking weather data, etc.
   - Create database models and connect to your PostgreSQL database.
   - Add routes for each function (e.g., logging fertilizer applications, retrieving weather data).

1. Database Integration (PostgreSQL)
   - Define your Postgres database connection string and configuration.
   - Use an ORM (SQLAlchemy or another async ORM) to create models corresponding to your lawn activity logs and weather data.
   - Create migration scripts if desired (with Alembic or similar tools) to set up and update your database schema.
1. Frontend Setup with React

   - Set up the frontend folder with a React project (using tools like Create React App or Vite).
   - Create basic components for displaying and logging lawn activities and weather data.
   - Learn the basics of React state and lifecycle to fetch data from the backend.
   - Set up routing using React Router if you plan to have multiple pages/views.

1. API Integration Between Frontend and Backend

   - Create a service layer (using axios or fetch) in React to call the FastAPI endpoints.
   - Test the endpoints manually (e.g., with Postman or curl) before integrating them into the UI.

1. Containerization with Docker

   - Write a Dockerfile for the backend (FastAPI app) that sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and runs the server (using uvicorn).
   - Write a Dockerfile for the frontend (React app) to build and serve your static assets.
   - Create a docker-compose.yml file to coordinate the services (backend, frontend, and Postgres database).

1. Local Testing and Debugging

   - Run the containers locally using Docker Compose and ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend, and the backend can access the database.
   - Set up logging and debug any issues.

1. Documentation and Future Enhancements
   - Document the project setup and instructions in a README file.
   - Plan for additional features, tests, and possibly CI/CD integration later on.
